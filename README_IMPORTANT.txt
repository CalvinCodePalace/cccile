IMPORTANT:

I AM ONLY PERMITTED TO SHOW THE BASE PHP FILES THAT I WORKED ON. ANY OTHER DEPENDENT FILES SUCH AS FILES THAT CONTAINED SQL DATABASE CREDENTIALS IS NOT PERMITTED TO BE SHOWN.
THEREFORE, MOST OF THE FEATURES WILL NOT FUNCTION WHEN TRYING TO USE IT DUE TO MISSING FUNCTIONS, CONNECTIONS, AND OTHER FILES. 

trackedQuery is a function that will automatically process a SQL query while adding a history including old data, new data, the query executed to a user-built tracking table on the SQL database.
